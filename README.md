In the field of regenerative medicine, human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) have attracted a lot of interest because of the capacity for self-renewal and the multipotentiality for differentiation[1]. However, the cellular activities of hBMSCs might be limited by the donor's age and pathological conditions. And the invasive procedure and inadequate collection make hBMSCs hard to clinical application[2]. HUCMSCs are isolated from the human umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly. They are abundant at cell source and exhibit a strong ability to proliferate and differentiate into multiple cell types[3]. Previous studies have shown that hUCMSCs seeded on scaffold materials can repair rat cranial defects, promote periodontal regeneration and increase the osteoporotic mandibular bone regeneration[4–6]. Therefore, hUCMSCs have becoming promising seed cells in bone tissue engineering.
