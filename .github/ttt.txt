As time passed, it became clear that even an excellent occlusion
was unsatisfactory if it was achieved at the expense of proper facial
proportions. Not only were there esthetic problems, it often proved
impossible to maintain an occlusal relationship achieved by pro
longed use of heavy elastics to pull the teeth together as Angle
and his followers had suggested. Under the leadership of Charles
Tweed in the United States and Raymond Begg in Australia (both
of whom had studied with Angle), extraction of teeth was rein
troduced into orthodontics in the 1940s and 1950s to enhance
facial esthetics and achieve better stability of the occlusal
relationships.
Cephalometric radiography, which enabled orthodontists to
measure the changes in tooth and jaw positions produced by growth
and treatment, came into widespread use after World War II. These
radiographs made it clear that many Class II and Class III maloc
clusions resulted from faulty jaw relationships, not just malposed
teeth. By use of cephalometrics, it also was possible to see that
jaw growth could be altered by orthodontic treatment. In Europe
the method of “functional jaw orthopedics” was developed to
enhance growth changes, while in the United States, extraoral
force came to be used for this purpose. At present, both functional
and extraoral appliances are used internationally to control and
modify growth and form. Obtaining correct or at least improved
jaw relationships became a goal of treatment by the mid-20th
century.
The changes in the goals of orthodontic treatment, which now
focus on facial proportions and the impact of the dentition on
facial appearance, have been codified in the form of the soft tissue
paradigm.4
